## Installation
- Grab the latest release of MetaphorFix from [here.](https://github.com/Lyall/MetaphorFix/releases)
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the the game folder. e.g. ("**steamapps\common\METAPHOR**" for Steam).

### Steam Deck/Linux Additional Instructions
ðŸš©**You do not need to do this if you are using Windows!**
- Open up the game properties in Steam and add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b" %command%` to the launch options.

## SpecialK
- As of the latest update for the game (5/10/24) [SpecialK](https://www.special-k.info/) is no longer essential for improving performance. Still, there are many other benefits to using SpecialK with this (and any other) game.
- If you are using this fix with SpecialK, you will need to delete the bundled Ultimate ASI Loader DLL (`winmm.dll`). You can then add MetaphorFix as a plug-in through the SpecialK OSD (accessed with `CTRL+SHIFT+BACKSPACE`).

## Configuration
- See **MetaphorFix.ini** to adjust settings for the fix.

## Known Issues
Please report any issues you see.
This list will contain bugs which may or may not be fixed.

#### HUD Fix
- Some 3D menu elements like pause screen text are invisible.
- Screen captures may appear squashed as they are resized to 16:9.
