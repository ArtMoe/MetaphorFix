## Recommended Mods
- [SpecialK](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2679460/discussions/0/4842022494093910068/) - I highly recommend using this build of SpecialK with Metaphor: ReFantazio. It can improve performance significantly, along with offering many other useful features like an excellent framerate limiter.
